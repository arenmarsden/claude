# Climate analysis using digital estimations

## Getting Started
To begin using CLAuDE, you need to first make sure you have [Git](https://git.com) and [Python 3.6 or later](https://python.com)
installed on your system.

Then, you can head over to our [scripts](./scripts) directory and download the script to install everything that is required. 
It's easy as that! We've done everything for you. All you need to do after that is execute the file via `python toy_model.py`.

## Backstory
CLAuDE is an acronym for "Climate Analysis Using Digital Estimations". It's main purpose is to model the climate of hypothetical planets, 
which could be Earth with slightly different parameters or entirely alien words.

The ultimate objective of this project is to create YouTube videos answering questions about hypothetical planets, such as 
"What would happen if the Earth span twice as fast". This would use the output from CLAuDE to create accurate representations of how 
these planets climates would behave under these altered, or completely fictional circumstances.

We hope that this project will become a useful scientific tool for teachers and students when discussing climate and atmospheric dynamics.
